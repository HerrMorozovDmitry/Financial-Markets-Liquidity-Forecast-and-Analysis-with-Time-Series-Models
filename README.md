# Financial-Markets-Liquidity-Forecast-and-Analysis-with-Time-Series-Models
When we decide to dive into the world of stock trading, it is very important to consider the liquidity of the market in which we are going to conduct operations in order to preserve and increase our capital. Why is that? First, because the more liquid the market is, the less risk our capital is exposed to, since for every asset there will always be people willing to buy or sell it. Secondly, the more liquid the market is, the more attractive it is for participants, which will always facilitate the opening of various transactions depending on our interests. Forecasting market liquidity is considered an extremely important task and requires a lot of attention. This is a serious problem due to the huge amount of data constantly updated and thus forecasting becomes a difficult task for investors investing money for profit.
